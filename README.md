his project demonstrates a simple and memory-efficient implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using a generator function in Python.

🔢 What is the Fibonacci Sequence?
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
📜 Description
This Python script defines a generator that yields the first n Fibonacci numbers. It is designed to be efficient and easy to understand, using Python's yield keyword to create an iterator.

✅ Features
Simple and clean generator-based implementation

Memory-efficient for large sequences

Easy to integrate into other Python projects

🧠 How It Works
python
Copy
Edit
def fibonacci_generator(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
n: Number of Fibonacci numbers to generate

a, b: Track the current and next values in the sequence

yield: Generates values one at a time without storing the full list in memory

▶️ Example Usage

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 10
    print(f"Fibonacci sequence for n={n}: {[x for x in fibonacci_generator(n)]}")
Output:

Fibonacci sequence for n=10: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

🛠️ Customization
You can modify the script to:

Generate an infinite Fibonacci sequence

Write the sequence to a file

Visualize the numbers using a plot library like matplotlib
